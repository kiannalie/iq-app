# Database Migration Checklist

This document tracks all features currently using local storage (AsyncStorage) that need to be migrated to Supabase database backend.

## Current Status: Local Storage (AsyncStorage)

All user data is currently stored locally on the device. Data will be lost if:
- User uninstalls the app
- User switches devices
- App data is cleared

---

## ðŸ”´ PRIORITY 1: Boards System

**Current Implementation:**
- File: `src/services/boardService.ts`
- Storage: AsyncStorage with key `@iqapp:boards`
- Features:
  - Create board with name and multiple board types
  - Load all user's boards
  - Update board details
  - Delete boards

**Database Requirements:**

### Tables Needed:

```sql
-- Boards table
CREATE TABLE boards (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Board types table (many-to-one with boards)
CREATE TABLE board_types (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  board_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES boards(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  color TEXT NOT NULL, -- Hex color code
  display_order INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_boards_user_id ON boards(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_board_types_board_id ON board_types(board_id);
```

### Row Level Security (RLS):

```sql
-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE boards ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE board_types ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Users can only see their own boards
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own boards"
  ON boards FOR SELECT
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own boards"
  ON boards FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own boards"
  ON boards FOR UPDATE
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own boards"
  ON boards FOR DELETE
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Board types follow board permissions
CREATE POLICY "Users can view board types for their boards"
  ON board_types FOR SELECT
  USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM boards
      WHERE boards.id = board_types.board_id
      AND boards.user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert board types for their boards"
  ON board_types FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM boards
      WHERE boards.id = board_types.board_id
      AND boards.user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

CREATE POLICY "Users can update board types for their boards"
  ON board_types FOR UPDATE
  USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM boards
      WHERE boards.id = board_types.board_id
      AND boards.user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete board types for their boards"
  ON board_types FOR DELETE
  USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM boards
      WHERE boards.id = board_types.board_id
      AND boards.user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );
```

### API Functions Needed:

Update `src/services/boardService.ts` to use Supabase:

```typescript
// Example migration for createBoard function:
async createBoard(name: string, types: BoardType[]): Promise<Board> {
  const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
  if (!user) throw new Error('Not authenticated');

  // Insert board
  const { data: board, error: boardError } = await supabase
    .from('boards')
    .insert({ user_id: user.id, name })
    .select()
    .single();

  if (boardError) throw boardError;

  // Insert board types
  const boardTypesData = types.map((type, index) => ({
    board_id: board.id,
    name: type.name,
    color: type.color,
    display_order: index,
  }));

  const { error: typesError } = await supabase
    .from('board_types')
    .insert(boardTypesData);

  if (typesError) throw typesError;

  return {
    id: board.id,
    name: board.name,
    types,
    createdAt: board.created_at,
    updatedAt: board.updated_at,
  };
}
```

### Migration Steps:

1. âœ… Create Supabase tables (see SQL above)
2. âœ… Set up RLS policies
3. âœ… Update `boardService.ts` to use Supabase client
4. âœ… Test CRUD operations
5. âœ… Create data migration script to move existing AsyncStorage data to Supabase
6. âœ… Add offline support with local caching
7. âœ… Handle sync conflicts

## ðŸŸ¡ FUTURE: User Preferences & Settings

**Will need migration when implemented:**
- User profile settings
- App preferences (theme, notifications, etc.)
- Tutorial/onboarding completion status

**Table Structure:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_preferences (
  user_id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  preferences JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

---

## ðŸŸ¡ FUTURE: Podcast/Episode Favorites

**Will need migration when implemented:**
- Saved podcasts
- Favorite episodes
- Listening history

**Table Structure:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE saved_podcasts (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  podcast_id TEXT NOT NULL, -- From Listen Notes API
  board_id UUID REFERENCES boards(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  saved_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE saved_episodes (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  episode_id TEXT NOT NULL, -- From Listen Notes API
  board_id UUID REFERENCES boards(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  saved_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE listening_history (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  episode_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  position INTEGER DEFAULT 0, -- Playback position in seconds
  completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  last_played_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## ðŸŸ¢ Already Using Database

### Authentication
- Using Supabase Auth
- No migration needed
- Users table managed by Supabase

---

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Board System (CURRENT PRIORITY)
1. Set up Supabase tables
2. Update boardService to use Supabase
3. Implement data sync
4. Add offline support

### Phase 2: User Preferences
1. Create preferences table
2. Migrate settings to database
3. Real-time preference sync

### Phase 3: Content Management
1. Create content tables
2. Link content to boards
3. Implement content sync

## Testing Checklist

Before migration:
- [ ] Export all test data from AsyncStorage
- [ ] Document current data structure
- [ ] Create backup mechanism

During migration:
- [ ] Test all CRUD operations with Supabase
- [ ] Verify RLS policies work correctly
- [ ] Test offline functionality
- [ ] Test sync after reconnection
- [ ] Test multi-device sync

After migration:
- [ ] Verify all existing data migrated correctly
- [ ] Monitor error logs
- [ ] Test data recovery process

---

## Files to Update During Migration

### Core Service Files:
- [ ] `src/services/boardService.ts` - Replace AsyncStorage with Supabase calls
- [ ] Create `src/services/supabaseClient.ts` if not exists
- [ ] Create `src/services/syncService.ts` for offline sync

### Screens:
- [ ] `src/screens/main/LibraryScreen.tsx` - Update error handling
- [ ] `src/screens/main/AddBoardScreen.tsx` - Update error handling

### Context:
- [ ] Consider creating `BoardContext` for state management

### Configuration:
- [ ] Update `.env` with Supabase credentials
- [ ] Update Supabase dashboard settings

---

## Rollback Plan

If migration fails:
1. Keep AsyncStorage code in a separate branch
2. Have feature flag to toggle between storage methods
3. Maintain data export functionality
4. Document rollback procedure

---

## Notes

- All TODO comments in `boardService.ts` mark locations that need database updates
- Keep the same interface (function signatures) to minimize screen changes
- Consider implementing optimistic updates for better UX
- Plan for data migration script to move existing user data
