# Product Overview

## Product Name
IQapp - Podcast & Audiobook Notes App

## Problem Statement
Podcast and audiobook listeners struggle to capture and organize insights in a way that is tied to the actual audio. Notes often end up scattered across different tools and lose the context of where in the episode or book the idea came from. Users need a seamless way to capture, organize, and revisit timestamped insights tied directly to audio content.

## Target Users

### Primary Audience
- Lifelong learners and self-improvement enthusiasts who regularly listen to podcasts/audiobooks and want to retain/apply what they hear
- Users who consume educational content and need to reference specific moments

### Secondary Audience
- Professionals who use podcasts/audiobooks for work-related learning (business leaders, students, creators)
- Knowledge workers who need to organize insights for future reference

## Core Value Proposition
Enable users to capture precise moments in audio content with timestamped notes and organize them into thematic playlists for easy retrieval and review.

## Key Features (MVP)

### Essential Features
1. **In-App Audio Playback** - Listen to podcasts/audiobooks directly within the app
2. **Timestamped Capture** - Save exact moments while listening with precise timestamp accuracy
3. **Contextual Notes** - Add notes and action items linked to specific timestamps
4. **Playlist Organization** - Organize saved clips into themed boards/playlists (Pinterest/Spotify-style)
5. **Insight Browser** - Browse all saved insights organized by topic in playlist view

### User Journey
1. User signs up and selects podcasts they follow
2. Starts listening to content in-app
3. At key moments, captures segments with timestamps
4. Adds notes and saves to themed playlists (e.g., "Time Management", "Leadership")
5. Later reviews playlists to access organized insights

## Success Metrics

### Activation

## Scope Boundaries

### Out of Scope (v1)
- Social features (sharing, following friends)
- Podcaster interaction or following
- Shared playlists or collaborative features
- Audiobook ingestion beyond public domain or existing integrations
- Advanced discovery algorithms

### Future Considerations
- Social discovery and sharing capabilities
- Enhanced content recommendation engine
- Podcast/audiobook creator partnerships
- Advanced organization and search features

## Key Assumptions & Risks

### Critical Assumptions
- Users will find manual timestamped note-taking valuable while listening
- Precise timestamp capture and syncing is technically feasible across platforms
- Users prefer in-app playback over external apps for note-taking context

### Technical Risks
- Podcast API limitations may restrict in-app playback capabilities
- Audio player integration complexity with reliable timestamp accuracy
- Platform-specific audio handling differences (iOS vs Android)

### User Experience Risks
- Note-taking during listening may be seen as disruptive to the listening experience
- Organization overhead may discourage consistent usage
- Value proposition may not be compelling enough for behavior change
